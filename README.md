# HARBOUR SPACE CHALLENGE

## How to run?

Install dependencies

`npm install`

Run application

`npm run start`

*Note: The Home page will redirect you to a details page of a scholarship*

Why this?

Because this example is about to make a View to load a Scholarship so the Home page won't be "necessary".

### Important Libs

- @emotion/css for dynamics css classes
- @tanstack/react-query for api call
- react for UI and State management
- react-router-dom for routing
- jest for testing
- tailwindcss for css
- vite for development

**IMPORTANT**

As the api call doesn't return any testimonial, the app will render 4 card templates of the slider only to show the micro interaction
