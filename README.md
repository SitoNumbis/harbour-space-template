# HARBOUR SPACE CHALLENGE

## How to run?

Install dependencies

`npm install`

Run application

`npm run start`

*Note: The Home page will redirect you to a details page of a scholarship*

Why this?

Because this example is about to make a View to load a Scholarship so the Home page won't be "necessary".
